# Challenge 14: React Portfolio
For this challenge, students will utilize the skill they have learned in `Module 14: React` to develop the initial scaffolding of their portfolio sites.

Now that you've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site as well as create and/or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Instructions
* Students must fullfil the requirements listed in the following sections:
  1. [Design](#design)
  2. [Components](#required-components)
  3. [Component Content](#required-component-content)
  4. [Updated Social Media Presence](#updated-social-media-presence)
     * [LinkedIn](#linkedin)
     * [GitHub](#github)

### Design
Remember, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look "polished" and "professional". Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
* If you want to go above and beyond, try using animations and react component libraries. Note that this will _not_ affect your grade, but it may impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.
