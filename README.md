This is not yet a polished website. Here is the deployed version: [deployed site](https://lyran.netlify.app/)
Will be making improvements to the site periodically.
In the meantime, it contains:

* React hooks and router functionality
* Some reusable code from class activities (as opose to re-inventing the wheel)
